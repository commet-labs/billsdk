BillSDK is a TypeScript library that handles billing logic inside your app. Define plans in code, store data in your database, swap payment providers without rewriting your integration. No SaaS middleman, no revenue share, no vendor lock-in.


### LLMs.txt

BillSDK exposes an `llms.txt` that helps AI models understand how to integrate and interact with your billing system. See it at [billsdk.com/llms.txt](https://billsdk.com/llms.txt).
