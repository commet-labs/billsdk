description: Billing SDK that runs inside your application
---

BillSDK is a billing engine that runs inside your application. You define plans and features in code, integrate with Stripe (or any payment provider), and ship billing in minutes.

## Why BillSDK

Billing SaaS platforms (Stripe Billing, Chargebee) lock you into their ecosystem, charge a percentage of your revenue, and run your billing logic on their servers.

Building billing yourself takes months and every edge case (trials, proration, failures) costs you revenue or angry customers.
