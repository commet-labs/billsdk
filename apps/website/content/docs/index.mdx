description: Billing SDK that runs inside your app
---

BillSDK handles billing logic. You own your data. Swap providers without rewriting code.

## Why BillSDK

- **vs SaaS platforms**: No revenue share, no vendor lock-in, data stays yours
- **vs building yourself**: Skip months of edge cases (trials, proration, failures)

```typescript
const billing = billsdk({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, { schema, provider: "pg" }),
  payment: stripePayment({ secretKey, webhookSecret }),
  plans: [
    { code: "free", prices: [{ amount: 0, interval: "monthly" }] },
    { code: "pro", prices: [{ amount: 2000, interval: "monthly" }] },
  ],
});
```
